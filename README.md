# Collaborative GitHub Learning Exercise

Welcome to our collaborative GitHub learning exercise! In this repository, we'll be working together to learn the basics of Git and GitHub. This README.md file serves as a guide for our collaborative process.

## Objective

The objective of this exercise is to familiarize ourselves with version control using Git and collaboration workflows on GitHub. By working together on this repository, we'll practice branching, committing, creating pull requests, and merging changes.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Set Up the Repository

- One person creates a new repository on GitHub.
- Add collaborators: Each person adds the other two as collaborators to the repository.
- Clone the repository locally: Each person clones the repository to their local machine using Git.

### 2. Branching and Committing

- Decide on a simple project or file to work on, such as a README.md file.
- Each person creates their own branch: One person creates a branch named `person1`, another creates `person2`, and the third creates `person3`.
- Make changes to the file: Each person makes some changes to the README file in their branch. These changes can be anything from adding text, fixing typos, or adding formatting.
- Commit changes: After making changes, each person commits their changes to their respective branch with descriptive commit messages.

### 3. Pull Requests

- Create pull requests: Each person creates a pull request (PR) from their branch to the main branch of the repository.
- Review each other's PRs: Take turns reviewing each other's pull requests. Provide feedback and suggestions if necessary.
- Merge pull requests: After the changes have been reviewed and approved, merge each pull request into the main branch.

### 4. Handling Conflicts (Optional)

- Intentionally create conflicting changes: For an additional learning experience, intentionally make conflicting changes in the same part of the file in two different branches.
- Resolve conflicts: When attempting to merge conflicting branches, GitHub will indicate the conflicts. Collaboratively resolve these conflicts by discussing and deciding on the final version of the file.
